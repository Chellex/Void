Feb/4/2014 - Not much more to say at the moment. I was able to free up some time and am now able to work on a more long term project. I am very excited because I've wanted to implement this idea for a few years now. Right now I am coding my own geometry backend as well as an Entity Framework so it's gonna be boring, (not really), for a while.
